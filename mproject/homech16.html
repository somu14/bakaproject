        <div id="impQ">Text 1: Sūta Gosvāmī said: O learned brāhmaṇas, Mahārāja Parīkṣit then began to rule over the
            world as a great devotee of the Lord under the instructions of the best of the twice-born brāhmaṇas. He
            ruled by those great qualities which were foretold by expert astrologers at the time of his birth.
            <div id="impQ">Text 2: King Parīkṣit married the daughter of King Uttara and begot four sons, headed by
                Mahārāja Janamejaya.</div>
            <div id="impQ">Text 3: Mahārāja Parīkṣit, after having selected Kṛpācārya for guidance as his spiritual
                master, performed three horse sacrifices on the banks of the Ganges. These were executed with sufficient
                rewards for the attendants. And at these sacrifices, even the common man could see demigods.</div>
            <div id="impQ">Text 4: Once, when Mahārāja Parīkṣit was on his way to conquer the world, he saw the master
                of Kali-yuga, who was lower than a śūdra, disguised as a king and hurting the legs of a cow and bull.
                The King at once caught hold of him to deal sufficient punishment.</div>
            <div id="impQ">Text 7: O Sūta Gosvāmī, there are those amongst men who desire freedom from death and get
                eternal life. They escape the slaughtering process by calling the controller of death, Yamarāja.

            </div>
            <div id="impQ">Text 10: Sūta Gosvāmī said: While Mahārāja Parīkṣit was residing in the capital of the Kuru empire, the symptoms of the Age of Kali began to infiltrate within the jurisdiction of his state. When he learned about this, he did not think the matter very palatable. This did, however, give him a chance to fight. He took up his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military activities.
            </div>
            <div id="impQ">Text 12: Mahārāja Parīkṣit then conquered all parts of the earthly planet — Bhadrāśva, Ketumāla, Bhārata, the northern Kuru, Kimpuruṣa, etc. — and exacted tributes from their respective rulers.
            </div>


            <div id="impN">Text 5: Śaunaka Ṛṣi inquired: Why did Mahārāja Parīkṣit simply punish him, since he was the
                lowest of the śūdras, having dressed as a king and having struck a cow on the leg? Please describe all
                these incidents if they relate to the topics of Lord Kṛṣṇa.
                <div id="impN">Text 6: The devotees of the Lord are accustomed to licking up the honey available from
                    the lotus feet of the Lord. What is the use of topics which simply waste one’s valuable life?</div>
            </div><div id="impN">Text 8: As long as Yamarāja, who causes everyone’s death, is present here, no one shall meet with death. The great sages have invited the controller of death, Yamarāja, who is the representative of the Lord. Living beings who are under his grip should take advantage by hearing the deathless nectar in the form of this narration of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord.</div>
            <div id="impN"> Text 9: Lazy human beings with paltry intelligence and a short duration of life pass the night sleeping and the day performing activities that are for naught.
